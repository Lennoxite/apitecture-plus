		<defName>ApiPlus_PrismLotus</defName>
		<label>Prism Lotus</label>
		<description>An extravagantly beautiful and absolutely aggravating plant to grow. The pollen and leaves of this plant carry a protein found nowhere else in nature, that causes every cell of the plant to refract light as though it's a prism. It is so profoundly delicate, that it can only grow under extremely favorable conditions, such as a hydroponics basin. The honey produced from this plant copies its light refraction capabilities, allowing it to be used in special spacer tech light applications.
		\nIt is said to be originally created by a hive that was inspired by a psychic wave of unknown origins.</description>
